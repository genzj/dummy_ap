            Fade duration in milliseconds for breathing effect.

    config LED_OUTPUT_INVERT

        help
            Enable GPIO output inversion for LED control.
            Set to 'y' if LED is pull-up (GPIO low = LED on).
            Set to 'n' if LED is pull-down (GPIO high = LED on).
            Pull-up ('y') is more common for its higher driven capacity.
